Once Upon a time, a new invention was born, its name was called "The mechaenical pencil", it sold for a jaw dropping price of 10, completely finished, jobs ( random stuff). This often times took the whole day to complete, for a single "special" pencil. At first it was cool, it was stylish, everybody wanted it, infact, many of the people were willing to work this long. This was because these pencils were always sharpened, and never dull, with almost infinite ink and a refillable lead socket. It also totally wrote neater ( not confirmed) although it was more fragil. After everybody ( EVERYBODY), had gotten at least a couple of the "special" pencils, they decieded to calm down, as they didn't need much more. This was when reality hit them. These penciels were no better than a sharp pencil, a sharp pencil was much much neater, cleaner, and beter, it was just forgetten through all the hype, as sharping was viewed as highly annoying. But new sharpening devices that were disbrutied was way cheaper, and public services provideed them ( although not as high quality). Nobody wanted to spend a days effort more into getting these pencils, in-fact after the inital wave. It never ever happened again. It was thrown awayed, builled, ripped appart, torn appart, treated as trash, and stolen many, many times without consequences. It was out of style and nobody thought the price was anywhere near reasonable as they reflected on the quality. It was the end of the age
